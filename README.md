HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually. Early detection and management are crucial to reducing mortality. Our project aims to
analyze patient data, develop machine learning models to predict heart disease, and provide actionable insights to hospitals for preventive measures.
